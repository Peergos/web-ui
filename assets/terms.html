<li><b>8.10</b> If any payment is declined, charged back, disputed or refunded by a third party card issuer or payment provider and this causes us to incur any liability (whether as a result of a payment reversal, return, surcharge, fine or otherwise), you authorise us to charge that fee to your Peergos Pro account.</li>
<li><b>8.11</b> You will be responsible for meeting any transaction fees (such as currency conversion).</li>
